# BlackJackBot
A visual based program that uses an object detection model to identify playing cards and can make strategic decisions in a game of blackjack.

There are two components to the project, the first is the object detection model and the second is the strategy model. 

Details on the training of the object detection model as well as the code and commands used are available in the "Playing_Card_Detector_V2.ipynb" file.
The file was originally created and run on Google Colab. It contains the process I used as well as credits for the code and information I used to help assemble it.
Huge thanks, in particular, to Geagx and EDJelectronics for the code and information that helped me to build the model.

The trained model is also available and it is also uploaded to github in the "playing_card_detection_master" repository on my account. This repo should also include the 
supporting data used in the training and various checkpoints in the model in stages of its training.
